# vue-horizontal-calendar

## Why did I start the project ?

A horizontal calendar makes it easy to display resources as rows and visualize a certain status for those resources
for date intervals. The type of visualization is not meant to be used on devices with small screens.
Still the final version will be functionally working fine on devices with small screens by having a scrollable table.
The visualization might make mostly sense in administrational environments.

## Usage ideas

- visualize people and their holidays
- visualize appartments and the days when they are free / booked
- visualize cars for renting
